# Mission To Mars

The purpose of this analysis is to use web-scraping tools to create a more dynamic website featuring the latest news, facts, and images of the planet Mars. Using BeautifulSoup and Splinter, data was scraped at the press of a "Data Scraping" button featured on the webpage and then stored into a Mongo database. Flask then ran the database through its application system to display the HTML formatted webpage. Using Bootstrap in the HTML code, the responsive website could accomodate a variety of display sizes.
